                    <p class="text-muted justify-text">
                    Have you ever found yourself puzzled over how to allocate your marketing budget effectively? You're not alone. Many marketers rely on intuition or past experience, resorting to a 'spray and pray' strategy that often wastes valuable resources.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted justify-text">
                    In an marketing era increasingly dictated by data, linear and traditional methods of budget allocation are becoming obsolete. This article introduces a novel method I have developed within PyMC-Marketing, which employs Bayesian statistical techniques to scientifically optimize marketing budget allocation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted justify-text">
                    The goal of this article is to equip marketing and data professionals with a deep understanding of this methodology.

                    <h2 class="text-primary fw-bolder mb-0 mb-left">Impressions-Based Models for Budget Allocation🧪</h2>
                    <p class="text-muted justify-text">
                    Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is a statistical analysis technique that deconstructs the various factors affecting a specific outcome—often sales—in the marketing realm. Through regression analysis, MMM quantifies the impact of each marketing channel and other variables like seasonality or economic indicators, to derive an optimal marketing strategy. By adjusting the model to include diverse market metrics beyond simple costs, MMM becomes a powerful tool for allocating budgets more effectively and for predicting future outcomes with greater accuracy.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted justify-text">
                    However, MMM are regression-based frameworks, meaning, they benefits significantly when both the target and predictors exhibit high variability. The spent on advertising platforms (mostly online platforms like facebook/google) often remains constant due to fixed rates and budgets, but the impressions generated can vary widely due to factors like consumer behavior, competition, and market dynamics. This variability in impressions even at the same level of spend is ignored when our model is train using spent for each channel as factors (regressors).
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted justify-text">
                    Creating an MMM model focusing solely on costs, overlooks the dynamic nature of 'impressions' which is a crucial variable that gauges the true reach of an advertisement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted justify-text">
                    By leveraging historical data, we introduce a method that captures impressions per euro spent along with their temporal fluctuations. This offers a nuanced way to allocate budget based on each channel's variable impression rates, as opposed to the more static cost-based models. The strength of this approach is its sensitivity to time. For instance, it reveals that the ROI for specific channels can differ month-to-month, thereby providing deeper insights for making agile budget adjustments.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="text-primary fw-bolder mb-0 mb-left">How it works? 💡</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted justify-text">
                    Let's picture a simple linear regression model where the response \( y \) (e.g., sales) is a function of a principal predictor \( x \) (e.g., advertising impressions): 
                    </p>
                    \[
                    y = \beta x + \epsilon
                    \]
                    <p class="text-muted justify-text">
                    Here, \( \beta \) is the coefficient, and \( \epsilon \) is the error term. Now, we introduce a saturation effect via the Michaelis-Menten equation:
                    </p>
                    \[
                    y = \alpha \times  \frac{\beta x}{\lambda + \beta x} + \epsilon
                    \]
                    <p class="text-muted justify-text">
                    In this equation, \( \alpha \) represents the maximum possible effect (e.g., the highest achievable sales), and \( \lambda \) is the "elbow point" where the curve changes direction. We are making \( \lambda \) time-sensitive. This is achieved by introducing a time variable \( t \) that modifies \( \lambda \):
                    </p>
                    \[
                    \lambda(t) = \frac{\lambda}{\text{Impressions-per-Euro}(t)}
                    \]
                    <p class="text-muted justify-text">
                    Substituting this time-sensitive \( \lambda(t) \) back into the Michaelis-Menten equation gives us:
                    </p>
                    \[
                    y = \alpha \times \frac{\beta x}{\lambda(t) + \beta x} + \epsilon
                    \]
                    <p class="text-muted justify-text">
                    This final equation incorporates the time-sensitive nature of \( \lambda \), effectively transforming our model into a time-adaptive version without affecting other aspects of the regression model. It's crucial to note that only \( \lambda \) is time-sensitive, not \( \alpha \) or \( \beta \), distinguishing this model from time-varying coefficient models.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-muted justify-text">
                    If your model is designed to focus directly on spend, the plot will provide a general representation of your immediate advertising impact, irrespective of time. However, our new approach allows for the inclusion of time-sensitive information by adjusting the model to an impressions-based configuration.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted justify-text">
                    To illustrate, if one of your channels generates 10 users at a level of 100k impressions, you can now divide the required impressions by the average impressions-per-euro for a specific month. This transforms your response curve from an impressions-based to a spend-based framework.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted justify-text">
                    To implement this, you'll need to adjust the \( \lambda \) parameter by dividing it by the monthly impressions-per-euro ratio. Why? \( \lambda \) determines the curve's directionality. By adjusting \( \lambda \), the curve will change its direction either sooner or later, depending on the divisor used.

                    By default, PyMC-Marketing doesn't include this type of curve. To implement it, you'll need to create a dictionary with keys corresponding to those in your original dictionary obtained via the <code>compute_channel_curve_optimization_parameters_original_scale</code> method. The values should be those estimated for impressions-per-euro from your prior analysis.

However, these initial estimates may not be optimal. By employing the <code>budget_allocator</code> method, you can iteratively fine-tune the distribution of your budget to find the optimal results.

                    In sum, the integration of impression-based models with Bayesian statistical frameworks in PyMC-Marketing offers a transformative approach to marketing budget allocation. By leveraging historical data, the method allows for a nuanced understanding of the variability in impressions per unit spend, thereby enabling more strategic, data-informed decision-making. The feature's time sensitivity adds a layer of granularity that traditional methods lack, making it possible to adjust budget allocations dynamically based on monthly performance metrics.

                    <p class="text-muted justify-text">
                        Additionally, the inclusion of constraints and iterative optimization techniques further refines budget allocation, ensuring that marketing resources are utilized to their fullest potential. The confluence of these elements empowers professionals to make more effective and efficient use of their advertising budgets.
