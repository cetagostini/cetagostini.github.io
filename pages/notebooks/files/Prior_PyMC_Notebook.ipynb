Now, as these tools fade away due to heightened virtual security measures, this drive has sparked the development of new statistical models to find the answer.\n",

        "Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) models, along with randomized and quasi-experiments, have emerged as key tools. Yet, measuring how advertisements influence people's decision-making is inherently challenging. Often, the methodology or model you choose and the conditions in which you apply it can lead to varying interpretations of reality.\n",

        "*Imagine this*: your company decides to dial back its advertising budget in **Venezuela** between March 28th and May 5th. Now, as a marketer, you're scratching your head, wondering: Did this decision affect sales? If so, how significantly?\n",

        "But why could we use this country as a comparison? This approach is grounded in the hypothesis that *Venezuela* and *Colombia* might be exposed to similar factors and conditions to a certain extent. By treating *Venezuela*'s sales as a function where *Colombia's* sales are a factor—owing to their exposure to similar conditions—we can account for much of the variability. This method allows us to focus on analyzing the residuals to see if they show any significant variations during the treatment period, offering deeper insights into the effects of our strategic decisions.\n",
