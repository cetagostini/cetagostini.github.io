<h1>Hi&nbsp;👋&nbsp;My name is Carlos Trujillo</h1>
<h2>Marketing Scientist</h2>
<p>I've been learning code for the last 5 years, I had to develop different programs in Python, relying on SQL and Non-SQL to build structures in the cloud that can handle large volumes of information.</p>
<p>That conducted me to explore services such as Airflow, CloudRun, App Engine, BigQuery, S3, DynamoDB, MongoDB, among others, side by side with the data engineering teams. However, my efforts and encouragement are constantly focused on the statistics and mathematics area, pursuing to analytically solve recurrent problems presented in different businesses, through computer vision techniques, natural language processing, regression or classification algorithms, and neural networks.</p>
