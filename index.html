    <p>Marketing scientist, data enthusiast and an artificial intelligence aficionado based in Tallinn, Estonia.</p>
    <p>For the last 5 years, I've surfed the tech wave all the way from Venezuela to Estonia, even working across Europe, Africa, and Latin America in creating cloud structures to handle large data volumes.</p>
    <p>🖥️ I thrive in exploring Airflow, CloudRun, App Engine, etc, applying assets like Python and SQL/Non-SQL practices while posting up new leading edges on machine learning and deep learning scopes. My undeniable passion lies within combining statistics and mathematics to solve recurring business problems by employing computer vision techniques, natural language processing, regression/classification algorithms alongside neural networks. 🎯 Recently, I got hooked onto learning Julia that would further augment my skills purse.</p>
