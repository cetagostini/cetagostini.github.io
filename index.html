    <h1 class="intro-title">Hello, World üåç!</h1>
    <h2 class="intro-subtitle">I'm Carlos</h2>
    <p>In the ever-changing landscape of the digital world, I found my calling - a passion that ignited within me a deep fascination for data science and artificial intelligence. Born in the vibrant town of Valencia, Venezuela, raised in Chile, and now settled in the enchanting land of Estonia, my journey has been a whirlwind of diverse experiences that have shaped me into the data professional I am today.</p>
    <p>For the past six years, I have dedicated myself to the world of data and AI, constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow. It was a movie called "The Greatest Hack" that first chock to the immense potential of data science, inspiring me to embark on a relentless pursuit of knowledge in this field.</p>
    <p>Throughout my career, I have been fortunate to work with teams not only in Estonia but also across continents, collaborating with professionals from Latin America, Europe, and Africa. This global exposure has not only enriched my expertise but has also allowed me to lead and guide teams ranging from four to ten individuals, fostering a dynamic environment that thrives on innovation.</p>
    <p>As a true believer in the power of data, I have witnessed how it can transform businesses by providing insights that lead to effective solutions. This belief fuels my dedication to solving complex business problems using data-driven methodologies. With a focus on statistics and mathematics, I strive to combine cutting-edge techniques such as computer vision, natural language processing, and regression/classification algorithms, along with the prowess of neural networks.</p>
    <p>Crafting cloud structures to handle vast data volumes has become second nature to me, utilizing tools like Airflow, CloudRun, App Engine, and others. My skillset encompasses Python, SQL, and No-SQL practices, allowing me to navigate the digital landscape with ease and confidence.</p>
    <p>As I tread this path of data exploration, I am guided by a philosophy that inspires me to take action and embrace challenges. "Double your actions and cut your excuses in half" is a mantra that propels me forward, motivating me to always push the boundaries of what I can achieve.</p>
    <p>In the pursuit of excellence, I am continuously expanding my knowledge, recently delving into the captivating world of Julia. I see every opportunity as a stepping stone towards becoming the best version of myself - a Marketing Scientist, data enthusiast, and AI aficionado, all rolled into one.</p>
    <p>If you want, we can connect, not only for data-driven discussions and collaborations but also to share any ideas to solve business problems - a realm of creativity and excitement that mirrors the very essence of data science.</p>
